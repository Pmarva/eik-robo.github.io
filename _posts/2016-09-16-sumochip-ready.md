No reason to wait more - we're almost ready. The new ~30€ WiFi enabled sumorobot
project we've worked on throughout the summer is [available at GitHub](https://github.com/eik-robo/sumochip/).
Assembly instructions online, build it yourself or get in touch for preorder.
Anything from bare PCB to fully assembled robot available from Robotics Club of Estonian IT College.
