We are the robotics club operating at the Estonian IT College.
The club is active since 2002.
Every year club members participate on the international robotics competition Robotex.

Goals:

* Applying knowledge acquired in the lectures through hands on approach
* Motivating students
* Self-realization 
* Promotion of Estonian IT College

To become a member simply show up at 412/413 room of Estonian IT College.
We try to have regular meetings on Thursdays 18:00, but 
check the calendar first!

It's not a problem if you're not Estonian IT College student,
we simply expect active participation in the club activities.
